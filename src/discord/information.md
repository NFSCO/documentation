# Welcome to NFSCO.
What started as a C++ modification aimed at providing online services is now an all-out overhaul project for a fan-favorite Need for Speed title.

NFSCO delivers the definitive Need for Speed: Carbon experience.

On top of providing scratch-made online services, the project expands and improves upon the game in numerous ways.
The project is set to release on 24.12.2024. This channel will be updated shortly before the release date.
